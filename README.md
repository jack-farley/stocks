This is an investing simulator allowing users to simulate the experience of investing 
in the market without risking any real money. Currently only stocks are supported.

To use the simulator, the user must first select an API to get current market data and
input their credentials for the api.

I have only implemented a console interface for this application so far, but I plan
to create a GUI at some point.
